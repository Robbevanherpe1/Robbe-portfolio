## Overview

In this project, I'am developing an interactive learning platform using Next.js, focused on teaching PL/I programming fundamentals. The goal is to create a structured, user-friendly educational tool that guides learners through essential PL/I concepts in a modular format. Each chapter introduces key topics in PL/I, with a design that emphasizes readability and ease of navigation. The platform is optimized for scalability, allowing additional chapters and content to be added seamlessly in the future.

## Key Features

- **Modular Chapter-Based Learning**: The platform organizes PL/I topics into distinct chapters, each presented as an interactive card. This modular format allows users to follow a structured path from basic to advanced topics.
- **Responsive and Accessible Design**: Built with accessibility and responsiveness in mind, ensuring an optimal learning experience across devices, whether on desktop or mobile.
- **Consistent Styling and Theming**: Implemented a consistent design theme with reusable components, leveraging CSS variables for easy adjustments to color schemes, typography, and layout styles. This approach enhances visual consistency across the site.
- **Intuitive Navigation and Progress Tracking**: Developed a sidebar and easy navigation features to allow learners to jump between chapters and track their learning journey effectively.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Each chapter component dynamically pulls in titles, subtopics, and descriptions, making it easy to update or expand content without altering the core structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Leveraged Next.js for server-rendered React components, enabling fast load times and SEO benefits.
- **CSS Modules and Variables**: Used CSS modules for scoped styling, along with CSS variables to handle theming and styling adjustments across components.
- **Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights**: Integrated Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to monitor and optimize performance, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Custom Font Integration**: Used local fonts for a unique visual identity, making the learning platform distinct and cohesive.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was ensuring that complex PL/I concepts were presented in an accessible way without overwhelming users. This was achieved by designing a clear, modular structure with intuitive navigation.
